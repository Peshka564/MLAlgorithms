# A python library for different ML algorithms + visualisation

**File structure:**     
* algorithms -> Implementation of the ML algorithms listed below(*)     
* plots -> Classes for each algorithm that allow manually adding points to a 2-D plane and visualising the classification boundary  
* assignments -> This is a collection of various applications of the algorithms(**)     
* data -> Various data for testing algorithms implementations       
This project includes realisations of common algorithms such as Linear and Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.    

(*) K-nearest neighbors, Perceptron classification, Multinomial/Gaussian Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression    
(**) Sources of the data and task requirements: https://github.com/aevanchen/machine_learning_miniprojects/tree/master

Made from scratch only using numpy, matplotlib and scipy
scikit-learn is only used for convenience and not in the implementation of the algorithms
