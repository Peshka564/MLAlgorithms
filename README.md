# A python library for different ML algorithms + visualisation

This project includes realisations of common algorithms such as Linear and Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.

It also allows for creating 2-D data using an interactive plot (i.e. by clicking to create points) and displays resulting boundaries

Made from scratch only using numpy, matplotlib and scipy
